                    <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                    <p>Around 7 years ago I opened my first ever live trade with real money
                        I made 70% return on my $50 account from that trade alone (beginner's luck)
                         
                        I got a feeling of the euphoria resulted from winning trades immediately
                        
                        However, I never tasted the feeling of winning consistently, not until 2 years later 
                         
                        Today, I see so many traders give up trading before reaching the consistency level, they lost so much money and time, and then locked in those losses by giving up on trading
                         
                        And that's what I want to change
                        I want every aspiring trader to experience winning consistently and see for themselves how it feels, see how their lives can change
                         
                        You no longer would worry about your job, you actually might even start thinking about quitting your job! You will start thinking about rewarding yourself and your family with the vacations and the life luxuries they deserve</p>
